The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program designed to assess the 
health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States 
(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html). As part of the NHANES, the CDC 
monitors biomarkers of chemical exposure 
(chiefly metabolites) in blood and urine to quantify the levels of chemical 
compounds present in U.S. residents 
(https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/resources/national-exposure-report.html). 
Each two-year study cycle comprises 
approximately 10,000 individuals, with exposure biomarker data for any given 
chemical available from only a subset of roughly 1/3 of the individuals in the 
study. In the 2024 publication “Characterizing Chemical Exposure Trends from 
NHANES Urinary Biomonitoring Data” (https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp12188) EPA 
scientists inferred steady-state 
daily intake rates (mg/kg bodyweight/day) for 179 chemicals from the NHANES 
urine samples. All values in the table refer to the median U.S. population 
intake rate – the credible intervals reflect the uncertainty in the median 
estimate and do not characterize variability.
