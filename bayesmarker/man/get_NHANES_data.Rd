\usage{
get_NHANES_data(codes_file = NULL, cohort = NULL, save_directory = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{codes_file}{Manually created xls or xlsx file containing 3 sheets:  1. NHANES chemicals to include (with identifier,
code, file, demographic, and units), 2. Associated weights, filenames, and column names associated with each phase used,
and 3. Parent-metabolite map containing chemical identifiers and molecular weights.}

\item{cohort}{String or character vector indicating which cohorts to limit the data downloads to. Cohorts should be
of length 5 representing the shortened dates for the cohort. For example "15-16" or c("01-02", "03-04").}

\item{save_directory}{String providing the directory in which to save the NHANES data files.  If left as the default,
NULL, it will save to ./rawData.  Otherwise, it will save to save_directory/rawData.}
}
\description{
Downloads NHANES data files needed for exposure inference based on a manually curated file describing which data to use.
Note that accuracy is very important for the input codes file. After "Starting Downloads" is printed to the console by
this function, no errors or warnings should be seen. Common issues when downloading the files are having incorrect
spelling of the file names (e.g. dem.xtpt instead of demo.xpt) and having the wrong phase and extension pair (e.g. 2015
\itemize{
\item 2016 files end in "_I.XPT"; will fail if this is "_F.XPT").
}
}
