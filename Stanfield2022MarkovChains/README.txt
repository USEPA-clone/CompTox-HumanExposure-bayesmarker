Bayesmarker Package Markov Chains
---------------------------------
This directory contains the Markov chains of all parent chemicals and metabolites in the 
Stanfield et. al., 2022 manuscript inferred from NHANES urine concentrations.

1000 samples were generated for 3 separate initial conditions for each population group
in each NHANES cohort for which data was available, resulting in 3000 MCMC samples.

Files starting with lPsamps represent the parent chemicals and files starting with lU 
represesnt the metabolites.
